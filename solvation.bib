	abstract = {Solvation free energies can now be calculated precisely from molecular simulations, providing a valuable test of the energy functions underlying these simulations. Here we briefly review {\textquotedblleft}alchemical{\textquotedblright} approaches for calculating the solvation free energies of small, neutral organic molecules from molecular simulations and illustrate these approaches by applying them to calculate aqueous solvation free energies (hydration free energies). These approaches use a nonphysical pathway to compute free energy differences from a simulation or set of simulations and appear to be a particularly robust and general-purpose approach for this task. We also present an update (version 0.5) to our FreeSolv database of experimental and calculated hydration free energies of neutral compounds and provide input files in formats for several simulation packages. This revision to FreeSolv provides calculated values generated with a single protocol and software version rather than the heterogeneous protocols used in the prior version of the database. We also further update the database to provide calculated enthalpies and entropies of hydration and some experimental enthalpies and entropies as well as electrostatic and nonpolar components of solvation free energies.},

	abstract = {A new pressure coupling method is described that combines Monte Carlo volume-space sampling with traditional molecular dynamics calculations to simulate the physical properties of molecular systems under standard conditions. The pressure is maintained by accepting or rejecting volume moves of newly propagated configurations using the Metropolis algorithm with probability P ( A V ) = rain(l, exp(( - 1/kTo)\{AE + PoAV - NkTo ln[(V + AV)/V]\})). The sample is further coupled to an external temperature bath using a variation of Andersen's stochastic collisions. The computational approach was implemented and applied to simulate the equilibrium properties of dense neon at various pressures. The results show the method to be both reliable and efficient for maintaining isothermal-isobaric conditions and should prove effective for studying the pressure dependence of physical properties in molecular systems.},

	abstract = {A mixed molecular dynamics/Monte Carlo (MD/MC) algorithm for constant pressure simulations of arbitrary molecular systems is examined. Calculations are reported at ambient and high pressures both for liquid water systems and for a chemical reaction step in a solvated enzyme utilizing empirical valence bond potentials. The present method reproduces earlier reported results well and is computationally efficient since it does not require the virial to be evaluated at each MD step. It is also found that the effects of introducing MC volume steps on the dynamics of the system are negligible provided that the volume step sizes and updating frequencies are appropriately chosen.},
